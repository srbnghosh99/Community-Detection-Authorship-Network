# Overview

The models in this directory are existing models for community detection.

The Louvain Algorithm required library from the link to be installed. "https://github.com/taynaud/python-louvain"

The spectral clustering model is from paper "Understanding Regularized Spectral Clustering via Graph Conductance". We did some minor revisions in the code to match with current networkx python library version. The mothodical parts remained unchanged. The code is from this github link. "https://github.com/crisbodnar/regularised-spectral-clustering/tree/master" 


The AMOS spectral clustering algorithm is from paper "AMOS: AN AUTOMATED MODEL ORDER SELECTION ALGORITHM FOR SPECTRAL GRAPH CLUSTERING". The code is from "https://github.com/tgensol/AMOS/tree/master" this link. 


## how to run the code?
