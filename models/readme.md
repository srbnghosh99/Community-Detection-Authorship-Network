# Overview

The models in this directory are existing models for community detection.

The Louvain Algorithm required library from the link to be installed. "https://github.com/taynaud/python-louvain"

The spectral clustering model is from paper "Understanding Regularized Spectral Clustering via Graph Conductance". We did some minor revisions in the code to match with current networkx python library version. The mothodical parts remained unchanged. The code is from this github link. "https://github.com/crisbodnar/regularised-spectral-clustering/tree/master" 


The AMOS spectral clustering algorithm is from paper "AMOS: AN AUTOMATED MODEL ORDER SELECTION ALGORITHM FOR SPECTRAL GRAPH CLUSTERING". Github link "https://github.com/tgensol/AMOS/tree/master". 

EgoSplitting clustering algoritm is from paper "Ego-Splitting Framework: from Non-Overlapping to Overlapping Clusters". The code has some minor revision to adjust with current library versions. Methodical sections remained unchanged. Github link "https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/EgoSplitting". 

DeepWalk clustering algoritm is from paper "DeepWalk: Online Learning of Social Representations". The code has some minor revision to adjust with current library versions. Methodical sections remained unchanged. Github link https://github.com/phanein/deepwalk/tree/master

DMGI clustering algoritm is from paper "Unsupervised Attributed Multiplex Network Embedding ". The code has some minor revision to adjust with current library versions. Methodical sections remained unchanged. Github link https://github.com/pcy1302/DMGI/tree/master

SDCN clustering algoritm is from paper "Structural Deep Clustering Network". The code has some minor revision to adjust with current library versions.  Methodical sections remained unchanged. Github link https://github.com/bdy9527/SDCN

AGE clustering algoritm is from paper "Adaptive Graph Encoder for Attributed Graph Embedding". The code has some minor revision to adjust with current library versions.  Methodical sections remained unchanged. Github link  https://github.com/thunlp/AGE/tree/master
